# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this post, we'll explore the basics of Next.js and how to get started with your first project.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features out of the box:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Built-in CSS and Sass support
- Fast refresh
- TypeScript support
- And much more!

## Creating Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
  â”œâ”€â”€ app/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ public/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/
  â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
  â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
  â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have your project set up, you can start building your application. Here are some things to try:

1. Create new pages in the `app` directory
2. Add some components
3. Style your application with CSS
4. Deploy your app to Vercel
