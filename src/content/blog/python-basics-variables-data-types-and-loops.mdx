# Introduction to Python Basics

Python is one of the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity and readability. In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover the fundamental concepts that every Python developer needs to know.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.

### Basic Variable Declaration

```python
# String variable
name = "John Doe"
# Integer variable
age = 25
# Float variable
height = 1.75
# Boolean variable
is_student = True
```

### Understanding Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

1. **Numeric Types**:
   ```python
   # Integer
   count = 100
   # Float
   price = 19.99
   # Complex number
   complex_num = 3 + 4j
   ```

2. **Sequence Types**:
   ```python
   # List (mutable)
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
   # Tuple (immutable)
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   # String (immutable)
   message = "Hello, World!"
   ```

3. **Mapping Type**:
   ```python
   # Dictionary
   person = {
       "name": "Jane",
       "age": 30,
       "city": "New York"
   }
   ```

4. **Set Types**:
   ```python
   # Set (unique elements)
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

## Control Flow and Loops

Python provides several ways to control the flow of your program.

### If Statements

```python
age = 18

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Adult")
```

### For Loops

Python's for loops are incredibly versatile:

```python
# Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Using range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4

# Looping through a dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### While Loops

While loops execute as long as a condition is true:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Practical Example: Temperature Converter

Let's put it all together with a practical example that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit:

```python
def convert_temperature():
    while True:
        print("\nTemperature Converter")
        print("1. Celsius to Fahrenheit")
        print("2. Fahrenheit to Celsius")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-3): ")
        
        if choice == "3":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
            
        try:
            temp = float(input("Enter temperature: "))
            
            if choice == "1":
                result = (temp * 9/5) + 32
                print(f"{temp}째C = {result}째F")
            elif choice == "2":
                result = (temp - 32) * 5/9
                print(f"{temp}째F = {result}째C")
            else:
                print("Invalid choice!")
                
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number!")

# Run the converter
convert_temperature()
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When working with Python basics, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**
   ```python
   # Good
   user_age = 25
   # Bad
   a = 25
   ```

2. **Type Checking**
   ```python
   # Check variable type
   value = "42"
   print(type(value))  # <class 'str'>
   ```

3. **List Comprehension**
   ```python
   # Create a list of squares
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   except ValueError:
       print("That's not a valid number!")
   ```

## Conclusion

Understanding variables, data types, and loops is crucial for Python programming. These fundamentals form the building blocks for more advanced concepts. Practice these concepts by creating small programs and experimenting with different scenarios.
