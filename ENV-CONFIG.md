# Environment Configuration

## Overview

The environment configuration for this application has been simplified to include only essential variables. All environment variables are stored in a single `.env` file at the project root.

## Environment Variables

The main `.env` file is currently empty as no environment variables are required. As new features are added that require environment variables, they will be documented here.

## Changes Made

1. **Minimalist Environment Configuration**:
   - Removed all non-essential environment variables
   - Created a single `.env` file with minimal configuration

## Testing Your Configuration

1. Make sure the `.env` file is present at the project root
2. Run the application with `npm run dev`
3. Test that all features work as expected

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues:

1. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that your network can connect to any required external services.
2. **Browser Console**: Check for any specific error messages in the browser console.
3. **Server Logs**: Check the server logs for any error messages.

## Deployment

When deploying the application:

1. Add any required environment variables to your deployment environment
2. For Vercel deployments, add them in the project settings under "Environment Variables"
3. For other hosting providers, follow their documentation for adding environment variables
